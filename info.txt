## Motivation
As a technology enthusiast passionate about AI, machine learning, and blockchain, I created this template to empower developers, technical writers, and students to leverage advanced language models like ChatGPT and integrate them seamlessly into their projects. The goal is to simplify the adoption of AI for generating content, enhancing productivity, and exploring innovative applications across various domains.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python dependencies installed in your environment:
- langchain
- langchain-anthropic
- python-dotenv
- wikipedia
- llm-math
- numexpr


You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install langchain langchain-anthropic python-dotenv wikipedia llm-math numexpr
```

## Recommended Platform
This template is optimized for development on Replit, providing a seamless environment for running Python scripts and experimenting with AI models.

## Usage Guide
### Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine or import it into your Replit workspace.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or Replit environment.

### Environment Setup
1. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.
2. Add your API keys or sensitive information in the format `KEY=VALUE` in the `.env` file.

### Running the Project
1. Open Visual Studio Code or Replit.
2. Open the terminal within VS Code or Replit and navigate to your project directory.
3. Execute the Python scripts (`main.py`, `practice.py`, etc.) as per your requirement.

### Example Use Cases
- **Product Descriptions**: Modify `implementation.py` to generate compelling product descriptions dynamically.
- **Interactive Documentation**: Use `practice.py` to query language models for technical documentation, aiding in content creation.
